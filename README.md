Week 2 JavaReview 02 for CSIS 2450 course

Although I made some progress and I have been able to display some outputs, I am still having trouble getting the correct output Please see my attachments.

1. The output for the variances calculation is off. I made separate methods and now I'm able to get a mean and variances (I think my math is right). I need to find out if the values coming from the 1st high and 2nd low index for each row and then calculated? I can't get the correct output like you are showing in the example output.

2. For the file and displaying a report into the .txt file. I was able to add a .txt file and I'm able to put the data into that file, but it looks like it does not over write the old information every time I execute the code. Instead what happens is when I execute the code the new data is added into the next line underneath the previous execution.

3. I'm still having trouble displaying the info in the graph part. I created a separate class but I'm getting confused on how to get the data from the first class since it's any matrix array with added data.

4. I still can't get the correct outputs in the Hi and Low and dates that show the highest and lowest date temperatures. I have some data that displays into the area but not the correct info.
